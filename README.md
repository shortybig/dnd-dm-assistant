this repository provides files of 5e monsters and their habitats from the following source books:
1) monster manual
2) volo's guide to monsters
3) mordenkainen's tome of foes

Functions include: 
1) create a random encounter where user inputs party size, party level, and optionally, habitat, difficulty, and number of monsters, and it returns difficulty, monsters and their count, and XP per party member.
2) report feasability of an encounter by entering party size, party level, number of monsters, and unadjusted total XP.
3) create a csv (or googlesheet) of suggested encounters to raise the party level by one. The encounters are randomly sorted and assigned quest numbers to also guide the DM in creating plotlines based on number of encounters and their difficulties.
